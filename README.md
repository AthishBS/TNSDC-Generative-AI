           Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce fake images which replicate the characteristics of the original data set is termed as image augmentation. The discriminator network works to differentiate between real and artificially produced images, while the generator network learns to generate realistic images by training a GAN on the data set that is available. The generator is able to generate new images with features and patterns that are equivalent to the original data once it has been trained. The training dataset can then be augmented with these generated images to boost its diversity and endurance. Using modifications like tilt, translation, scaling, and noise furthermore, this augmentation method can enhance the dataset and maximize the efficiency of machine learning models that have been trained on it.  GAN-based augmentation allows models to perform better on an assortment of computer vision tasks and to more efficiently generalize to previously unidentified data.
